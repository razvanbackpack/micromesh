# MiniPHP

MiniPHP is a very small and lightweight PHP framework that I built as a learning project.

### What can it do:
- Basic routing
  - Only GET implemented for now
- Blade template engine

### How to
Follow the `WelcomeController.php` example from `src/Controllers/` 

### Running

First, you must install composer and run  
```composer install```

Then start a PHP server:  
```php -S 127.0.0.1:8000```

Enjoy!
